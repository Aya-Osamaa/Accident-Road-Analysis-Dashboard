# Accident-Road-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed A data analysis Python , Power BI dashboard project exploring road accident patterns, response times, and risk factors across U.S. states.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of road accidents across different U.S. states to uncover meaningful patterns related to:
ğŸ”¹Accident frequency and severity
ğŸ”¹Emergency response times
ğŸ”¹Environmental and road conditions
ğŸ”¹Driver and vehicle profiles

## Tools & Technologies
ğŸ”¹Python: Data cleaning and preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)
ğŸ”¹Google Colab: Environment for Python coding
ğŸ”¹Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly: Data visualization
ğŸ”¹Power BI: Dashboard creation and storytelling
ğŸ”¹DAX: For calculated metrics and KPIs

## Key Features of the Dashboard
ğŸ”¹Monthly trends of accidents by state
ğŸ”¹Accidents by weather, road, and light conditions
ğŸ”¹Average emergency response time by region
ğŸ”¹Speed vs. casualty scatter analysis
ğŸ”¹Interactive slicers for filtering by state, time, and accident type
